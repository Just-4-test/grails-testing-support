Artifacts under test are subjected to dependency injection just like they are
in the running application.  The unit testing environment does not spin up the
entire Spring application context with all of the beans that would normally be
configured in the running application.  Unit tests may register any beans
necessary to carry out the test by defining a static method in the test named
`doWithSpring`.  The syntax available in this closure is the same syntax that
may be used in `grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy` for defining bean
definitions.
